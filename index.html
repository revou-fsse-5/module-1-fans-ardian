                <p><b>SUN</b> is the <i> “Head of the Family” </i> of the Solar System, but at the same time it is a star that is not much different from other stars that are usually visible at night. 
                    The only difference is that it is closest to Earth compared to other stars. The distance between the Sun and Earth is around 150 million km, which is usually defined as 1 astronomical unit (1 sa or 1 au). 
                    The diameter is ± 1,400,000 km (Earth ± 12,750 km).
                <br>
                <br>
                The light looked brilliant white. However, after observing it with a special device, it turned out that the surface of the Sun was not as white and smooth as it seemed. Often there are black spots called sunspots of various sizes. 
                The temperature at the center is said to be 15 million 0C and this is where energy generation occurs through the nuclear process. With such intense heat, a granulation phenomenon occurs on the surface of the Sun (like the distribution of air bubbles on the surface of boiling water). 
                Meanwhile, what we usually see every day is the outer layer of the Sun which is only about 500 km thick, called the photosphere, which emits light that is dazzling to the eye. There are many phenomena related to its activity, including explosions on the surface where material can often be scattered to the edge of the Solar System.

                    <center><h2 id="bulan" class="fonthead3">MOON</h2></center>
                    <p>On a clear night, in conditions far from air pollution and city light, the star-studded night sky shows its true nature. It is understandable that this phenomenon has influenced human thought patterns since the presence of humans themselves on Earth, including any phenomena related to the Goddess of the Moonlight Night.
                    <br>
                    <br>   
                    After the Sun, with its various splendors, which are present as a necessary condition for life, the Moon also offers a pattern of repetition in its journey across its orbit around the Earth. The regularity of changes in his face gave rise to various inspirations, not to mention various mythologies that were born and even the emergence of a lunar-based calendar system. At certain times, 
                    humans finally try to record various phenomena related to them in a more structured way. Universally, past thoughts regarding the Moon could be the same as now. What is different is the presence of various facilities in terms of science and technology. So, in the present era, with similar curiosity and imagination, astronomers study everything related to the Moon based on their observations in the realm of form, 
                    then process it in mathematical language (called observational science), then try to analyze it (called theoretical science). However, in the end he found a return – something that made him feel amazement, a sense of astonishment in the realm of his spirit.
